### The extracted `zsh` shell for Git Bash for Windows.

Based on this: https://gist.github.com/fworks/af4c896c9de47d827d4caa6fd7154b6b

The downloaded `.zst` must be extracted with Peazip. In order to skip the unnecesary install of the program, you can get the contents from this folder `zsh-extracted-contents`.
